# Python Ghost Hunter
The house is haunted with a dangerous ghost! Can you capture it before it gets you?
Python Ghost Hunter is a game inspired by Phasmophobia. 
The player enters a haunted house and is trying to find where the ghost is.
After finding where it is, they have to investigate further and find out what kind of ghost it is.
But the clock is ticking, and the ghost is not happy that you are there.
